On separate lines, outline the logical steps you'd follow to solve the problem. 
Steps might include prompt for year, prompt for day of year, validate year, 
calculate month, print month, day, year, etc.



1. prompt user for year 
    if year is <= 0 then produce an error
        else keep going
2. I need to call the is_leap_year fcn like i did in the calendar lab
    ex: leap_year = is_leap_year(num)

3. A leap year has 366 days
4. Normal years have 365

5. prompt user for days in range of 365/ 366 (depending on leap year or not)
    if the day entered is <= 0 error
        else keep going

6. I need to find a way to specify the number of days in a month
    ex: Feb has 29 days on a leap year and 27 on a normal year
7. Specify the months

8. if the year is a leap year then i need to add one day to it 
    if its a leap year then febuary goes up one day

9. Figure out a way to find the respective month for the day...

10. return the month, day, and year 




day = input year
if day < 0
    error






functions i need:

1. start()
    void fnc that encapsulates all of my code
        will use this is start code at the end 

2. is_leap_year(year)
    fun defined in lab 4 
        code already done

2. valid_year(year)
    produces true/false if year is valid/invalid
        need to use true/false

3. valid_day_of_year(year, valid_day_of_year)
    check if day is valid and produces true/false 

4. input_year()
    code that prompts user for the year

5. input_day_of_year(year)
    prompt user of day of the year 
        ex: 364
    should return 0 if day is invalifd
    I should be calling valid_day_of_year and valid_year

6. get_days_in_year(year)
    returns 0 for invalid year 
    or
    num of days as an int

7. valid_month(month)
    returns true if month is valid (ex: 0 < month <= 12)
    or
    false for an invalid month
        "Month must be > 0 " and "Month must be <= 12"

8. translate_month(month)
    returns empty string for invalid month  
        call valid_month()
    or
    the month as a fill string

9. get_days_in_month(year,month)
    returns num of days in a month as an int    
        I need to account of a leap year    
            if leap year + 1 days 
    or retunr 0 if month or year is invalid 

10. valid_day(year, month, day)
    returns flase if the year,month, OR day is invalid 
    or
    true if everything checks out

11. get_date_string(year, month, day)
    returns empty string if year,month, OR day is invalid 
    or
    string formatted as Month Day, year (Ex: December 1, 2018)
