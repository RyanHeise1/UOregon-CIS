- In this project, I implemented a program that initiates and schedules a workload of 
other processes.  This User Space Process Scheduler reads a list of programs, with arguments, from a file specified as an 
argument to the scheduler (uses standard input if unspecified), starts up the programs in 
processes, and then schedules the processes to run concurrently in a time-sliced manner.  
It will also monitor the processes, keeping track of how the processes are using system 
resources.
